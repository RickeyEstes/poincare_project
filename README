This is an experiment to put my blog posts from

http://jtauber.com/poincare_project/

into a git repository to track history, allow people to file issues, fork and
make pull requests.

I'm still working out what format to put these in and how to publish more
presentable versions.

Here is how I described the original content on my blog:

"""
I am currently working through the mathematics required to understand the
Poincar√© Conjecture and the possible solution recently proposed. I want to
blog my journey and I started out summarising the basic foundations of pure
mathematics necessary to get to the conjecture-specific parts. Now that I've
got to explaining the conjecture, posts are about the background in
differential geometry to understand the proofs.
