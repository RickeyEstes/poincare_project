Poincaré Project
================

This is an experiment to put my blog posts from

http://jtauber.com/poincare_project/

into a git repository to track history, allow people to file issues, fork and
make pull requests.

I'm porting over one post at a time into Sphinx and publishing them to

http://poincare-project.readthedocs.org/

Here is how I described the original content on my blog:

    I am currently working through the mathematics required to understand the Poincaré Conjecture and the possible solution recently proposed. I want to blog my journey and I started out summarising the basic foundations of pure mathematics necessary to get to the conjecture-specific parts. Now that I've got to explaining the conjecture, posts are about the background in differential geometry to understand the proofs.
