Poincaré Project
================

Based on the blog posts at http://jtauber.com/poincare_project/.

    I am currently working through the mathematics required to understand the Poincaré Conjecture and the possible solution recently proposed. I want to blog my journey and I started out summarising the basic foundations of pure mathematics necessary to get to the conjecture-specific parts. Now that I've got to explaining the conjecture, posts are about the background in differential geometry to understand the proofs.
